# Sign-Language-Translator

# dataset
The dataset, and a few tensorflow files are to big to upload to github, although its available in OneDrive the link is https://livemdxac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/an808_live_mdx_ac_uk/EoarB0PB9etBj85mikRyqtcBuQRki8b0Vhb-UJ5XyJK-7Q?e=8wNvv7

 # Motivation
 
  Sign language is fairly new to the eyes of the public, meaning that, only in 2009 England recognize British Sign language as a language, so there is not much research on this subject.The deaf community suffers daily from communication problems such as Public announcements the famous sentence " Mind the gap "it's not perceptible for the Hearing Impaired. My idea with this project is to reach out to this people and try to give them something that will have a positive impact and bridge the deaf and the nondeaf communities by allowing them to communicate with each other and hence improve the lives of these people that have been and still are neglected up to this day.
 
 # Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
 
  CNN's are very useful for image recognition and their classification. A Neural Network is a series of perceptrons linked together to form a network very similar to the way our brains work. For a comprehensive guide about CNN please click here. 
In my project, i used ConvNet because I was dealing with image recognition and there are pre-made models which have a very high probability to find the correct class of images.
 
 # Sci kit-learn
 
 Sci kit-learn is a python library dedicated to machine learning for python. I comes equipped with the necessary tools such as classifiers, regression and clustering. This tools come pre-loaded with a hand-full of useful algorithms varying from support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting and k-means.For more information visit their website
 
 # TensorFlow
 
  TensorFlow is a machine learning platform developed by Google, it features multiple CNN algorithms, it allows you to write your own CNN algorithm or use pre-train models. TensorFlow is famous because they train an AlexNet model in millions of pictures using ImageNet online Database.
  For my project, I'm researching which method is preferable for a sign language translator CNN or machine learning using classification algorithms such as k nearest neighbor (KNN). TensorFlow allows you train the last the last layer of a CNN and retrain the model using your own dataset. For more information visit the TensorFlow website or my report
  
  # OpenCv
  
  OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage and is now maintained by Itseez.
  Since my project involve image analysis, I'm using python with OpenCV libraries to scale, threshold, and modify the images, video or the live stream webcam so that it can be deployed and used by Movidius.
  
  # code
  This projects uses two platforms the TensorFlow platform and sci kit-learn, both codes are available in GitHub. Bare in mind the TensorFlow model uses a technique called transfer learning and in my case it didn't not work as expected.
